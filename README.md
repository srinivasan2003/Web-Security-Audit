# Web Security Audit Tool

This project provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to audit the security of web applications. It consists of two main Python scripts: one for analyzing web security headers and another for performing in-depth security scans on a target domain.

## Features

### 1. Security Header Analyzer (`security_header.py`)
This script analyzes the HTTP security headers of a given website and grades it based on the presence and configuration of the following headers:

- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces secure (HTTPS) connections.
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Mitigates the risk of XSS and other code injection attacks.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Adds an extra layer of protection against XSS attacks.
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is included with requests.
- **Permissions-Policy**: Manages permissions for browser features.

### 2. Web Audit Tool (`web-audit.py`)
This script performs a series of security tests on a target domain using various security tools. It helps identify vulnerabilities and provides suggestions for remediation.

- **Vulnerability Classification**: Issues are classified as `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `informational`.
- **Interactive Scanning**: Allows skipping tests or quitting the scan interactively.
- **Multiple Security Scanners**: Utilizes tools like `nmap`, `SSLyze`, `wafw00f`, and more for comprehensive security checks.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

The `web-audit.py` script relies on several third-party security tools. Ensure these are installed and accessible in your system's PATH:

- **Nmap**: Network exploration tool and security/port scanner.
- **SSLyze**: Fast and comprehensive SSL/TLS configuration analyzer.
- **wafw00f**: Web application firewall detection tool.
- **Uniscan**: A vulnerability scanner and directory checker.
- **theHarvester**: Email, subdomain, and name search tool.
- **DNSRecon**: DNS reconnaissance tool.
- **dirb**: Web content scanner and directory brute-forcing tool.
- **XSser**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability scanner.

You can install these tools on Ubuntu-based systems using:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nmap sslyze wafw00f uniscan theharvester dnsrecon dirb xsser
```

### Python Packages

This project requires the following Python packages:
- `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework.
- `termcolor`: Utility for printing colored text to the terminal.

You can install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, you can install the packages individually:
```bash
pip install aiohttp termcolor
```

### Operating System

This project is best suited for Unix-like operating systems, particularly:
- **Ubuntu 20.04+**: Recommended for its ease of installation of required tools and packages.
- **Kali Linux**: Ideal for penetration testing and security auditing, as it comes pre-installed with many required tools.

While the scripts may work on other operating systems, they are developed and tested primarily on Ubuntu and Kali Linux.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srinivasan2003/Web-Security-Audit.git
   cd Web-Security-Audit
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nmap sslyze wafw00f uniscan theharvester dnsrecon dirb xsser
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that the required tools are in your system's PATH.

## Usage

### Security Header Analyzer (`security_header.py`)

This script analyzes the security headers of a single URL or multiple URLs listed in a file.

#### Analyze a Single URL
```bash
python3 security_header.py https://example.com
```

#### Analyze Multiple URLs from a File
```bash
python3 security_header.py --file urls.txt
```

The results will be saved to an output file and displayed in the terminal.

### Web Audit Tool (`web-audit.py`)

This script performs a comprehensive security audit of a web domain using a variety of security scanners.

#### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 web-audit.py example.com
```

#### Skip Specific Tests
```bash
python3 web-audit.py example.com --skip dmitry --skip theHarvester
```

#### Disable Spinner/Loader
```bash
python3 web-audit.py example.com --nospinner
```

The tool will display a summary of findings along with recommendations for remediation.
